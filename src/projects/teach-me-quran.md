Client was looking for a content management system (CMS) but wanted a unique feature where potential customers can click on an icon that connect them directly with the service provider through a social media platform  (i.e. Whatsapp)  in order to encourage customers  with different digital literacy to enquire directly to teachers available on mobile devices. This was achieved by a plugin.
