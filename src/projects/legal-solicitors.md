Client asked for a modern and adaptive website that can be updated on a regular basis by admin. After Several meetings using storyboards, I got a crystal clear idea about the concept ,design and functionalities  my client is looking forward to. Legal and Legal Solicitors were looking for a website that connects their presence on different social media platforms with their new website instead of their previous static site. I suggested  using Wordpress as a starting point, as it has many plugs including blog posts , which is ideal for immigration lawyers looking to push new content out there on law updates from the government authorities

For this website, I have not only made adjustments on clients' needs by wordpress plugins, I have also added my own knowledge of CSS and PHP by changing files when needed.  Furthermore,  I have  carefully looked after the server-side by hosting their website on my own Virtual Private Server as a subdomain, as the client does not want to launch their website until everything is in order.
