Decided to create a small scale Android application after finding little mobile applications out there without too much bloatware regarding covid stats,  that can pull data from opendata.nhs.scot that gives a responsive and  quick amount of information using user location. This was achieved by matching users/phones Geo positioning with available data.The data regions are listed by the National Health Service Board  (NHSB).NHSScotland consists of 14 regional NHS Boards. For Example Greater Glasgow and Clyde for my current location. Still in the prototype stage.
