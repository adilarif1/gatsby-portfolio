My own project in the early prototype stage, a service that mimics JustEat, an online food service, but instead provides customers  with fresh meat  from  theri local butchers by delivery and collection. Users location is taken and  nearest available butcher are given by distance. This data is pulled by googleâ€™s Places API. The front-end website was built using React JS and Bulma and the back-end will be built using Python on a scalable cloud service.
