NFT focused on helping new emerging artists to get exposure.

Organization vision: No more starving artists, a platform to empower artists. 

Money raised from NFTs of this project can be invested in new emerging artists to recieve exposure or even help them finance their launch for a much smaller royalty than those of record labels.
To put it into perspective record labels take from 50% off the biggest stars all the way to 80%. 

A website and community will be built that allows users from around the world to vote for new emerging artists to be promoted or aid in launching their careers.

Longer term goal: releasing a crypto currency token as a form of investment by investors with a percentage initially invested by both myself and my partner which in turn could see our initial funding of the crypto currency rocket. This could create persay share holders with the royalties that return from our investment in the creators and artists continue to add additional value to both the organization and returns to the investors.

The project shall be named "No Hungry Artists" with the tokens named NSA tokens.
