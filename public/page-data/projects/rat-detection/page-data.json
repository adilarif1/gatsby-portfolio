I decided to create a mobile application that takes advantage of my phone's front-facing camera sensor [], that is capable of motion detection at Â¾ inches away. Depending on the phone's hardware, some phones even reach a distance of over a metre. The application functions by the sensor being triggered and then captures photos that are then stored on the users storage. This helped me find the root of entry of mice and seal it to fix the problem once for good .The app is Functional, though still to finalise for Google Play Store.</p>\n<p>Tags: Android Studio, Java and camera sensor</p>","frontmatter":{"stack":"Android Studio & Java","title":"Rodent Motion","featuredImg":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f898a8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/c2f87b49ac43e2c89fabe65b92826471/4b8c2/rodent.png","srcSet":"/static/c2f87b49ac43e2c89fabe65b92826471/4164c/rodent.png 166w,\n/static/c2f87b49ac43e2c89fabe65b92826471/8868a/rodent.png 332w,\n/static/c2f87b49ac43e2c89fabe65b92826471/4b8c2/rodent.png 664w","sizes":"(min-width: 664px) 664px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/c2f87b49ac43e2c89fabe65b92826471/d508f/rodent.webp 166w,\n/static/c2f87b49ac43e2c89fabe65b92826471/1c8f9/rodent.webp 332w,\n/static/c2f87b49ac43e2c89fabe65b92826471/ee4e5/rodent.webp 664w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 664px) 664px, 100vw"}]},"width":664,"height":300}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"rat-detection"}},
